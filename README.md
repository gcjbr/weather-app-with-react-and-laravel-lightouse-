# Weather app

This is small app I buit for a coding interview

The backend was written in **Laravel** and it's using the [The Weather Api](https://www.weatherapi.com/) api to generate an easy GraphQL endpoint for our app. The front end users React and Apollo to consume the API.

## How to configure

-   Copy **dot.env.example** to a new **dot.env** and edit what is needed. I purposefully left my Weather Api key there so you guys have one less step so set it up.
-   Run **composer install** on the root directory.
-   Run **npm install** on the root directory.
-   Run **npm run dev** to compile the assets.

## How to run

If you are using Windows, [you can follow these instructions](https://phpcoder.tech/how-to-run-laravel-project-on-localhost/). On Mac, I'd recommend using [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/valet)
